    id: "6",
    question: "What are the components in React ?",
    answer: "Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately."
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "What is Functional Components ?",
    answer: "These types of components have no state of their own and only contain render methods, and therefore are also called stateless components. They may derive data from other components as props (properties)."
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "What is Class Components ?",
    answer: "These types of components can hold and manage their own state and have a separate render method to return JSX on the screen. They are also called Stateful components as they can have a state."

    id: "9",
    question: "What is the use of render() in React ?",

  {
    id: "10",
    question: "What is a state in React ?",
    answer: "The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time, and whenever it changes, the component re-renders."
  },

    id: "11",
    question: " How do you update the state of a component ?",

    question: "What is a higher-order component in React ?",
    answer: " A higher-order component acts as a container for other components. This helps to keep components simple and enables re-usability. They are generally used when multiple components have to use a common logic."
